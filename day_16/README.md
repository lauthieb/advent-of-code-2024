## Description

### Part One

It's time again for the [Reindeer Olympics](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/14)! This year, the big event is the _Reindeer Maze_, where the Reindeer compete for the _<span title="I would say it's like Reindeer Golf, but knowing Reindeer, it's almost certainly nothing like Reindeer Golf.">lowest score</span>_.

You and The Historians arrive to search for the Chief right as the event is about to start. It wouldn't hurt to watch a little, right?

The Reindeer start on the Start Tile (marked `S`) facing _East_ and need to reach the End Tile (marked `E`). They can move forward one tile at a time (increasing their score by `1` point), but never into a wall (`#`). They can also rotate clockwise or counterclockwise 90 degrees at a time (increasing their score by `1000` points).

To figure out the best place to sit, you start by grabbing a map (your puzzle input) from a nearby kiosk. For example:

    ###############
    #.......#....E#
    #.#.###.#.###.#
    #.....#.#...#.#
    #.###.#####.#.#
    #.#.#.......#.#
    #.#.#####.###.#
    #...........#.#
    ###.#.#####.#.#
    #...#.....#.#.#
    #.#.#.###.#.#.#
    #.....#...#.#.#
    #.###.#.#.#.#.#
    #S..#.....#...#
    ###############
    

There are many paths through this maze, but taking any of the best paths would incur a score of only _`7036`_. This can be achieved by taking a total of `36` steps forward and turning 90 degrees a total of `7` times:

    
    ###############
    #.......#....E#
    #.#.###.#.###^#
    #.....#.#...#^#
    #.###.#####.#^#
    #.#.#.......#^#
    #.#.#####.###^#
    #..>>>>>>>>v#^#
    ###^#.#####v#^#
    #>>^#.....#v#^#
    #^#.#.###.#v#^#
    #^....#...#v#^#
    #^###.#.#.#v#^#
    #S..#.....#>>^#
    ###############
    

Here's a second example:

    #################
    #...#...#...#..E#
    #.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#
    #.#.#.#...#...#.#
    #.#.#.#.###.#.#.#
    #...#.#.#.....#.#
    #.#.#.#.#.#####.#
    #.#...#.#.#.....#
    #.#.#####.#.###.#
    #.#.#.......#...#
    #.#.###.#####.###
    #.#.#...#.....#.#
    #.#.#.#####.###.#
    #.#.#.........#.#
    #.#.#.#########.#
    #S#.............#
    #################
    

In this maze, the best paths cost _`11048`_ points; following one such path would look like this:

    #################
    #...#...#...#..E#
    #.#.#.#.#.#.#.#^#
    #.#.#.#...#...#^#
    #.#.#.#.###.#.#^#
    #>>v#.#.#.....#^#
    #^#v#.#.#.#####^#
    #^#v..#.#.#>>>>^#
    #^#v#####.#^###.#
    #^#v#..>>>>^#...#
    #^#v###^#####.###
    #^#v#>>^#.....#.#
    #^#v#^#####.###.#
    #^#v#^........#.#
    #^#v#^#########.#
    #S#>>^..........#
    #################
    

Note that the path shown above includes one 90 degree turn as the very first move, rotating the Reindeer from facing East to facing North.

Analyze your map carefully. _What is the lowest score a Reindeer could possibly get?_
